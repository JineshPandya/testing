<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p>Born in India but been living in Australia since I was 10. Mainly we use my native language which is Gujarati at home but since I have been here since I was 10, feels like English is my first language. I currently work as Computer Technician (Hardware), in port Melbourne. Fun Fact about me is that I learnt French when I was in High School and got 2nd Prize in a French Speaking Comp.</p>

<h3>INTREST IN IT</h3>
<p>My interest in IT started when I first got my laptop for school, I always wondered how these Machine Worked and how all different components came together to make a single computer work.  When it comes to Repairing Laptops, I broke the Charging port in my laptop and when I saw how the Technician was fixing /repairing the Motherboard got me excited about getting my hands fixing laptops. After I passed year 11, I built my own PC and wanted always work with Computers since then.</p>
<p>I chose to come to RMIT because before I started working full time as Computer Technician, I was studying at RMIT (on campus), learning CERT IV in IT.  As RMIT stands for Royal Melbourne Institution of Technology, I realized this could be the University where I start my IT Studies.</p>
<p>From studying Introduction to IT, I wish to learn the basic HTML, and learn how to get a westie up and running. As I want to be a Web Developer this is the perfect place to get new information and study how website is made.</p>
